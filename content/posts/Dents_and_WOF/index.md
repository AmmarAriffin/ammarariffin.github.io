Somebody bumped me when going to a roundabout and made some paint chips on the bottom rear.

And also a large dent on the rear door which would definitely fail WOF(Warrant of Fitness for NZ) as per the guideline below.

Luckily though, the dent on the rear door can be fixed with
the [boiling water trick](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifehacks/comments/9pwzfx/using_boiling_water_to_get_car_dents_out/) and some [dent pullers](https://www.supercheapauto.co.nz/p/sca-sca-dent-puller---mini-single-cup-suction/344524.html?cgid=SCN01100305#start=1). I bought the mini ones
compared to the large ones as they would have a hard time sticking near the dent as it needs a flat area in the first place to stick.

The trick made just enough work to pass the guidelines of requiring below 40mm.

Although with this trick, its almost always never would completely remove the dents.

For the paint chip, the [official website](https://vehicleinspection.nzta.govt.nz/virms/in-service-wof-and-cof/heavy-vehicles/vehicle-structure/structure#tab1) did say something about "significant corrosion or delamination" which applies to the paint chip, but how significant it is for me to find out during my inspection.
